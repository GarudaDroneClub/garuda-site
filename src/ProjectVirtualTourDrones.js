      <p>
        The drone system for virtual university tours is an innovative solution designed to assist parents
        during the admissions process. This system deploys drones equipped with high-definition cameras 
        to capture real-time video footage of the campus. The footage is streamed to an interactive platform, 
        allowing parents to explore various university facilities remotely. The drone system offers a 
        comprehensive view of the university, providing a vivid and immersive experience. This technology ensures 
        that parents can gain a thorough understanding of the campus environment, even if they are unable to visit 
        in person.
